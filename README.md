# SmartGrazer

SmartGrazer stands for Smart Grammatical Fuzzer. The goal of this project was to create a pentest-tool, which can automatically generate payloads to bypass a given WAF.

This project was implemented during my master thesis. The thesis can be found here: [Thesis                         ](https://github.com/b1tray3r/SmartGrazer/blob/master/doc/thesis/2017-11-29%20-%20Masterthesis%20-%20Alexander%20Borgardt.pdf)
